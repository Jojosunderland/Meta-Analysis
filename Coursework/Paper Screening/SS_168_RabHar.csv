The immediate adaptive solution to this mismatch is phenotypic plasticity, either in phenology of seasonal colour moults or in behaviours that reduce mismatch or its consequences. We observed nearly 200 snowshoe hares across a wide range of snow conditions and two study sites in Montana, USA, and found minimal plasticity in response to mismatch between coat colour and background. We found that moult phenology varied between studysites, likely due to differences in photoperiod and climate, but was largely fixed within study sites with only minimal plasticity to snow conditions during the spring white-to-brown moult. We also found no evidence that hares modify their behaviour in response to colour mismatch. Hiding and fleeing behaviours and resting spot preference of hares were more affected by variables related to season, site and concealment by vegetation, than by colour mismatch. We conclude that plasticity in moult phenology and behaviours in snowshoe hares is insufficient for adaptation to camouflage mismatch, suggesting that any future adaptation to climate change will require natural selection on moult phenology or behaviour.",MAY 7,2014,281,1782,,,20140029,10.1098/rspb.2014.0029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2014.0029,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Population-level susceptibility to mismatches depends on how phenology and phenotypic plasticity vary across a species' distributional range. Here, we quantify the environmental drivers of colour moult phenology, phenotypic plasticity, and the extent of phenological mismatch in seasonal camouflage to assess vulnerability to mismatch in a common North American mammal. Location North America. Time period 2010-2017. Major taxa studied Snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Methods We used > 5,500 by-catch photographs of snowshoe hares from 448 remote camera trap sites at three independent study areas. To quantify moult phenology and phenotypic plasticity, we used multinomial logistic regression models that incorporated geospatial and high-resolution climate data. We estimated occurrence of camouflage mismatch between hares' coat colour and the presence and absence of snow over 7 years of monitoring. Results Spatial and temporal variation in moult phenology depended on local climate conditions more so than on latitude. First, hares in colder, snowier areas moulted earlier in the fall and later in the spring. Next, hares exhibited phenotypic plasticity in moult phenology in response to annual variation in temperature and snow duration, especially in the spring. Finally, the occurrence of camouflage mismatch varied in space and time; white hares on dark, snowless background occurred primarily during low-snow years in regions characterized by shallow, short-lasting snowpack. Main conclusions Long-term climate and annual variation in snow and temperature determine coat colour moult phenology in snowshoe hares. In most areas, climate change leads to shorter snow seasons, but the occurrence of camouflage mismatch varies across the species' range. Our results underscore the population-specific susceptibility to climate change-induced stressors and the necessity to understand this variation to prioritize the populations most vulnerable under global environmental change.",MAR,2020,29,3,503,515,,10.1111/geb.13049,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/geb.13049,DEC 2019,View Full Record in Web of Science

One particularly important adaptation is seasonal coat colour (SCC) moulting. Over 20 species of birds and mammals distributed across the northern hemisphere undergo complete, biannual colour change from brown in the summer to completely white in the winter. But as climate change decreases duration of snow cover, seasonally winter white species (including the snowshoe hare Lepus americanus, Arctic fox Vulpes lagopus and willow ptarmigan Lagopus lagopus) become highly contrasted against dark snowless backgrounds. The negative consequences of camouflage mismatch and adaptive potential is of high interest for conservation. Here we provide the first comprehensive review across birds and mammals of the adaptive value and mechanisms underpinning SCC moulting. We found that across species, the main function of SCC moults is seasonal camouflage against snow, and photoperiod is the main driver of the moult phenology. Next, although many underlying mechanisms remain unclear, mammalian species share similarities in some aspects of hair growth, neuroendocrine control, and the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on moult phenology. The underlying basis of SCC moults in birds is less understood and differs from mammals in several aspects. Lastly, our synthesis suggests that due to limited plasticity in SCC moulting, evolutionary adaptation will be necessary to mediate future camouflage mismatch and a detailed understanding of the SCC moulting will be needed to manage populations effectively under climate change.",AUG,2018,93,3,1478,1498,,10.1111/brv.12405,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.12405,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, climate change has been implicated in the range contraction of snowshoe hares along the southern range boundary. With shortening snow season duration, snowshoe hares are experiencing increased camouflage mismatch with their environment reducing survival. Phenological variation of hare molt at regional scales could facilitate local adaptation in the face of climate change, but the level of variation, especially along the southern range boundary, is unknown. Using a network of trail cameras and historical museum specimens, we (1) developed contemporary and historical molt phenology curves in the Upper Great Lakes region, USA, (2) calculated molt rate and variability in and among populations, and (3) quantified the relationship of molt characteristics to environmental conditions for snowshoe hares across North America. We found that snowshoe hares across the region exhibited similar fall and spring molt phenologies, rates and variation. Yet, an insular island population of hares on Isle Royale National Park, MI, completed their molt a week earlier in the fall and initiated molt almost 2 weeks later in the spring as well as exhibited slower rates of molting in the fall season compared to the mainland. Over the last 100 years, snowshoe hares across the region have not shifted in fall molt timing; though contemporary spring molt appears to have advanced by 17 days (similar to 4 days per decade) compared to historical molt phenology. Our research indicates that some variation in molt phenology exists for snowshoe hares in the Upper Great Lakes region, but whether this variation is enough to offset the consequences of climate change remains to be seen.",MAY,2023,202,1,69,82,,10.1007/s00442-023-05371-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-023-05371-4,MAY 2023,View Full Record in Web of Science

We studied individual and population-level fitness costs of a climate change-induced stressor: camouflage mismatch in seasonally colour molting species confronting decreasing snow cover duration. Based on field measurements of radiocollared snowshoe hares, we found strong selection on coat colour molt phenology, such that animals mismatched with the colour of their background experienced weekly survival decreases up to 7%. In the absence of adaptive response, we show that these mortality costs would result in strong population-level declines by the end of the century.

The consequences of such mismatches are difficult to link to specific future climate change scenarios because the responses across trophic levels have complex underlying climate drivers often confounded by other stressors. In contrast, seasonal coat color polyphenism creating camouflage against snow is a direct and potentially severe type of seasonal mismatch if crypsis becomes compromised by the animal being white when snow is absent. It is unknown whether plasticity in the initiation or rate of coat color change will be able to reduce mismatch between the seasonal coat color and an increasingly snow-free background. We find that natural populations of snowshoe hares exposed to 3 y of widely varying snowpack have plasticity in the rate of the spring white-to-brown molt, but not in either the initiation dates of color change or the rate of the fall brown-to-white molt. Using an ensemble of locally downscaled climate projections, we also show that annual average duration of snowpack is forecast to decrease by 29-35 d by midcentury and 40-69 d by the end of the century. Without evolution in coat color phenology, the reduced snow duration will increase the number of days that white hares will be mismatched on a snowless background by four-to eightfold by the end of the century.

Globally, multiple species moult from a dark summer to white winter coat to maintain camouflage against snowy landscapes. Decreasing snow cover duration owing to climate change is increasing mismatch in seasonal camouflage. To directly test for adaptive responses to recent changes in snow cover, we repeated historical (1950s) field studies of moult phenology in mountain hares (Lepus timidus) in Scotland. We found little evidence that population moult phenology has shifted to align seasonal coat colour with shorter snow seasons, or that phenotypic plasticity prevented increases in camouflage mismatch.

Declining snow duration has severe negative consequences for diverse taxa including seasonally color molting species, which rely on snow for camouflage. However, phenotypic plasticity may facilitate adaptation to reduced snow duration. Plastic responses could occur in the color molt phenology or through behavior that minimizes coat color mismatch or its consequences. We quantified molt phenology of 200 wild snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), and measured microhabitat choice and local snow cover. Similar to other studies, we found that hares did not show behavioral plasticity to minimize coat color mismatch via background matching; instead they preferred colder, snow free areas regardless of their coat color. Furthermore, hares did not behaviorally mitigate the negative consequences of mismatch by choosing resting sites with denser vegetation cover when mismatched. Importantly, we demonstrated plasticity in the initiation and the rate of the molt and established the direct effect of snow on molt phenology; greater snow cover was associated with whiter hares and this association was not due to whiter hares preferring snowier areas. However, despite the observed snow-mediated plasticity in molt phenology, camouflage mismatch with white hares on brown snowless ground persisted and was more frequent during early snowmelt. Thus, we find no evidence that phenotypic plasticity in snowshoe hares is sufficient to facilitate adaptive rescue to camouflage mismatch under climate change.",NOV,2020,194,3,301,310,,10.1007/s00442-020-04680-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00442-020-04680-2,JUN 2020,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this study, we use gene expression to understand seasonal coat colour moulting in wild snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). We used hair colour to follow the progression of the moult, simultaneously sampling skin from three moulting stages in hares collected during the peak of the spring moult from white winter to brown summer pelage. Using RNA sequencing, we tested whether patterns of expression were consistent with predictions based on the established phases of the hair growth cycle. We found functionally consistent clustering across skin types, with 766 genes differentially expressed between moult stages. White pelage showed more differentially expressed genes that were upregulated relative to other skin types, involved in the transition between late telogen (quiescent stage) and the onset of anagen (proliferative stage). Skin samples from transitional intermediate and brown pelage were transcriptionally similar and resembled the regressive transition to catagen (regressive stage). We also detected differential expression of several key circadian clock and pigmentation genes, providing important means to dissect the bases of alternate seasonal colour morphs. Our results reveal that pelage colour is a useful biomarker for seasonal change but that there is a consistent lag between the main gene expression waves and change in visible coat colour.

Seasonal coat colour change is an adaptation that has evolved in multiple mammal and bird species occupying areas that experience seasonal snow cover. It has a critical impact on fitness as predation risk may increase when an individual is mismatched against its habitat's background colour. In this paper, we investigate the correlation between landscape covariates and moult timing in a native winter-adapted herbivore, the mountain hare (Lepus timidus), throughout Norway. Data was collected between 2011 and 2019 at 678 camera trap locations deployed across an environmental gradient. Based on this data, we created a Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that quantified the correlations between landscape covariates and coat colour phenology and analysed among season and year moult timing variation. Our results demonstrate that mountain hare moult timing is strongly correlated with altitude and latitude with hares that live at higher latitudes and altitudes keeping their winter white coats for longer than their conspecifics that inhabit lower latitudes and altitudes. Moult timing was also weakly correlated with climate zone with hares that live in coastal climates keeping their winter white coats for longer than hares that live in continental climates.

We analyzed 12 yr of data from 622 snow tracking lines in southeast Norway along a gradient in annual duration of snow-covered ground. The mountain hare abundance index was positively related to the generalist predator abundance index, probably due to a combined numerical and functional response of the predators. The mountain hare abundance index was negatively associated with a short duration of snow cover, and this effect was stronger in areas with a high predator abundance index. Hence, we demonstrated a causal link between the mountain hare abundance index, predators, and the duration of snow cover.

Here, we evaluate the potential of behavioral plasticity to buffer against camouflage mismatch in mountain hares Lepus timidus in Scotland.

Hares did not prefer to rest closer to light-colored rocks or farther from conspecifics with increasing color contrast. Furthermore, whiter hares did not seek to rest closer to snowy backgrounds; rather, hares preferred to sit farther from snow.

However, characterizing such phenological processes is difficult, expensive, and time consuming. Remote camera traps are increasingly used in ecology, yet their potential to study key phenological traits in animal populations has been largely unexplored. Here, we examine the potential of remote camera traps to measure the progression of seasonal molts in mammals. We evaluated the accuracy of trained observers to classify the stage of molt from camera-trap images and identified factors that increase the accuracy of this method in a common, color molting mammal, the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). Our results showed that images taken by remote camera traps can be used to classify the stage of color molt with relatively high accuracy (i.e., 84%). Observers achieved the highest accuracy when using a classification protocol with fewer molt categories, and from images acquired during the day. We also found that hare body position in the image, and whether the hare was moving or still had small influences on observer classification accuracy. Camera model had negligible effect on accuracy. Overall, our results suggest that camera traps can be used to classify molt progression to measure molt phenology in the wild. Because many camera-trap studies are ongoing around the world, images of species that undergo distinguishable seasonal molts could be pooled across studies to characterize molt phenology on local and global scales.

In many high-latitude and high-altitude areas, the duration and depth of snow cover has been substantially reduced in the last five decades. This reduction in depth and duration of snow cover may create a mismatch between coat colour and colour of the background environment, and potentially reduce the survival rate of species that depend on crypsis. We used long-term (1977-2020) field data and capture-mark-recapture models to test the hypothesis that whiteness of the coat influences winter apparent survival in a cyclic population of snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) at Kluane, Yukon, Canada. Whiteness of the snowshoe hare coat in autumn declined during this study, and snowshoe hares with a greater proportion of whiteness in their coats in autumn survived better during winter. However, whiteness of the coat in spring did not affect subsequent summer survival. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the timing of coat colour change in autumn can reduce overwinter survival. Because declines in cyclic snowshoe hare populations are strongly affected by low winter survival, the timing of coat colour change may adversely affect snowshoe hare population dynamics as climate change continues.",APR 12,2023,290,1996,,,20221421,10.1098/rspb.2022.1421,http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2022.1421,,View Full Record in Web of Science

While such distributional changes are often observed at broad scales, the processes driving them - colonization and extinction along range boundaries - occur at local scales. There is a need then, to identify whether these local drivers are consistent with patterns at broader scales. Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus), an important prey species in northern forest ecosystems, have experienced range contraction along much of their southern boundary. Population declines are linked to climate change via camouflage mismatch, an inability to match seasonal coat color molts with declining snow cover duration. We used data from camera traps to monitor the spatial extent and habitat associations of hares before, during and after an experimental translocation, and multi season occupancy models to model the effects of habitat and climate on colonization and extinction patterns. We compared our contemporary occupancy models to historical patterns of extirpation and simulated future effects of timber harvest on occupancy. Colonization by hares was strongly associated with distance from source population and patch size of aspen-alder. Historical patterns of extirpation were consistent with contemporary patterns, and simulations revealed that increased frequency and magnitude of aspen harvest increased hare occupancy by creating large patches of early-successional habitat. As global change alters ecological communities, identifying mechanisms that drive range-shifts and targeting landscape features that can be manipulated to buffer those effects can be used to promote the persistence of individual species and ecological communities.",SEP,2020,249,,,,108731,10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108731,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108731,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we assume that the shift in the phenology of a species' food abundance is, by a first approximation, an appropriate yardstick. We review the few examples that are available, ranging from birds to marine plankton.

Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) typically molt into white winter coats to remain camouflaged against snow. In some warmer climates, hares have evolved brown winter camouflage-an adaptation that may spread in response to climate change. We used extensive range-wide genomic data to (1) resolve broad patterns of population structure and gene flow and (2) investigate the factors shaping the origins and distribution of winter-brown camouflage variation. In coastal Pacific Northwest (PNW) populations, winter-brown camouflage is known to be determined by a recessive haplotype at the Agouti pigmentation gene. Our phylogeographic analyses revealed deep structure and limited gene flow between PNW and more northern Boreal populations, where winter-brown camouflage is rare along the range edge. Genome sequencing of a winter-brown snowshoe hare from Alaska shows that it lacks the winter-brown PNW haplotype, reflecting a history of convergent phenotypic evolution. However, the PNW haplotype does occur at low frequency in a winter-white population from Montana, consistent with the spread of a locally deleterious recessive variant that is masked from selection when rare. Simulations of this population further show that this masking effect would greatly slow the selective increase of the winter-brown Agouti allele should it suddenly become beneficial (e.g., owing to dramatic declines in snow cover). Our findings underscore how allelic dominance can shape the geographic extent and rate of convergent adaptation in response to rapidly changing environments.",SEP,2020,74,9,2033,2045,,10.1111/evo.13976,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evo.13976,MAY 2020,View Full Record in Web of Science

This phenomenon has been demonstrated in terrestrial and aquatic realms, but data and knowledge are limited on how early life stages of fish are affected over long-term and broad environmental scales. Here, we analyze 2 decades (1974-1996) of size class-specific Baltic herring Clupea harengus membras L. larval data along the whole coast of Finland to expose shifts in phenology linked to changes in environmental covariates. We use a novel Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal hurdle model that describes larval occurrence and abundance with separate processes. Abundances are modeled with the Ricker population growth model that enables us to predict size-specific larvae groups in relation to the environment while accounting for population density dependence. We quantify shifts in phenology at multiple life stages, based on first appearances of smallest larvae (<10 mm) and by detection of higher proportions of larger larvae (>15 mm) appearing earlier than they have done historically. Our results show a strong signal in shifting phenology of the larvae toward an earlier development of 7.7 d per decade. Increasing temperature had a positive effect on the earlier development of larger larvae. Additionally, we highlight that the survival of larvae becomes more density dependent as their size increases.

Shifts in phenology are an important consequence of environmental change. Measuring phenology of different taxa simultaneously at the same spatial and temporal scale is necessary to study the effects of changes in phenology on ecosystems. Camera traps that take both time-lapse as well as motion-triggered images are increasingly used to study wildlife populations. The by-catch data of these networks of camera traps provide a potential alternative for measuring several climatic and phenological variables. Here, we tested this ability of camera traps, and quantified climatic variables as well as the timing of changes in plant and animal phenology. We obtained data from 193 camera-unit deployments during a year of camera trapping on a peninsula in northern Sweden aimed at studying wildlife. We estimated daily temperature at noon and snow cover using recordings provided by cameras. Estimates of snow cover were accurate, but temperature estimates were higher compared with a local weather station. Furthermore, we were able to identify the timing of leaf emergence and senescence for birches (Betulasp.) and the presence of bilberry berries (Vaccinium myrtillus), as important food sources for herbivores. These were linked to the timing of the growth of antlers and the presence of new-born young for three ungulate species as well as the presence of migratory Eurasian cranes (Grus grus). We also identified the timing of spring and autumn moulting of mountain hares (Lepus timidus) in relation to snow cover.

Alone, these changes are ecologically important; however, for some fish populations, management practices may unknowingly interact with climate-induced changes in reproductive phenology, leading to unanticipated changes in fishing mortality. The potential for such an interaction exists for the Chesapeake Bay Striped Bass Morone saxatilis fishery, which opens on the same week each year during the spawning season. Earlier migrants spawn before the fishery opens; however, later migrants are vulnerable to fishing before they reach the spawning grounds. Consequently, if there are climate-induced changes in Striped Bass spawning phenology, unexpected levels of fishing mortality may occur for egg-bearing, prespawn females. To evaluate the potential consequences of this temporally fixed fishing season, we analyzed a time series of gill-net catch data using an inference-based modeling approach to identify the environmental cues driving variation in the migratory timing of Striped Bass onto their two primary spawning grounds. We hypothesized that factors driving migratory timing would also influence the proportion of egg-bearing, prespawn females caught in the fishery each year. Results indicated that spring water temperature was the primary factor influencing the timing of movement onto spawning grounds, with higher temperatures resulting in early migrations. Importantly, our results indicated that in cool years, when females moved onto the spawning grounds later, more egg-bearing females were caught in the fishery before they could spawn. This situation provides impetus for establishing management approaches that reduce potential climate-induced variability in fishing mortality in the Chesapeake Bay and fisheries around the globe.

We measured eggspace' temperatures adjacent to natural egg clutches in populations distributed across a range of latitudes (36 degrees 8-44 degrees 6) and altitudes (213-3171 m). Eggs laid > 50 cm above the ground averaged 3.1 degrees C cooler than ambient air at 1 m height, while eggs at < 1 cm height averaged 15.5 degrees C hotter than ambient, ranging up to 47 degrees C. Because of differences in egg height, eggs at 3171 m elevation and 20.6 degrees C ambient air experienced mean eggspace temperatures 7 degrees C hotter than those at 213 m elevation and ambient 33.3 degrees C. Experimental eggs survived for one hour at 45 degrees C but were killed by 48 degrees C. Eggs laid low, by positively geotactic butterflies, risked thermal stress. However, at populations where eggs were laid lowest, higher oviposition would have incurred incidental predation from grazers. Interpopulation variation in phenology influenced thermal environment and buffered exposure to thermal stress. At sites with hotter July temperatures, the single annual flight/oviposition period was advanced such that eggs were laid on earlier dates, with cooler ambient temperatures. The insects possessed two mechanisms for advancing egg phenology; they could advance timing of larval diapause-breaking and/or shorten the life cycle by becoming smaller adults. Mean weight of newly-eclosed females varied among populations from 92 to 285 mg, suggesting that variable adult size did influence phenology. Possible options for in situ mitigation of thermal stress include further advancing phenology and raising egg height. We argue that these options exist, as evidenced by current variation in these traits and by failure of E. editha to conform to restrictive biogeographic constraints, such as the expectation that populations at equatorial and poleward range limits be confined to higher and lower elevations, respectively.

Snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) are particularly vulnerable to decreasing snow cover and resultant camouflage mismatch. This species shares a suite of predators with alternative prey species including porcupines (Erethizon dorsatum) and ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus), and all three species historically exhibited synchronized population dynamics. Recently, the community has become partially disassembled, notably with the loss of snowshoe hares and associated enemy-mediated indirect interactions resulting from declining snow duration. Specifically, we hypothesized that the extirpation of hares in the early 1990s indirectly increased predation pressure on ruffed grouse and porcupines. To test our hypothesis, we experimentally translocated 96 snowshoe hares to a site within a regional ecotone between northern and southern forests where snowshoe hares were recently extirpated and monitored community members before, during, and after translocation. Ruffed grouse were only loosely associated with the biotic interactions that linked porcupines and snowshoe hares, likely due to predation occurring from avian predators and strong negative direct effects of declining winter snow depths. In contrast, predation of neonate porcupines was virtually non-existent following repatriation, compared with periods without hares. This abrupt attenuation of predation did not increase overall survival due to increased non-predation mortality from cold, early spring weather. Porcupines directly benefited from warming winters: decreased snow cover increased adult survival and warmer temperatures around parturition increased maternal condition and reduced non-predation causes of mortality for neonates. Our experimental manipulation suggests that enemy-mediated indirect interactions were likely to be important features of this community; however, climate change has disrupted these interactions, resulting in extirpation of a central prey species (snowshoe hare) and increased predation of an alternative prey species (porcupine). We show complex effects from climate change with some species directly and negatively affected, while others benefited from direct effects of warming winters, but suffered negative effects from indirect interactions. Due to absent snowshoe hares and associated biotic interactions, continued persistence of this community module is unlikely, potentially resulting in altered no-analog communities along trailing edge distributions.",AUG,2022,92,3,,,e1509,10.1002/ecm.1509,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ecm.1509,APR 2022,View Full Record in Web of Science

As derived from the regression of the resting metabolic rate of nonfasting birds at night (RMR) on molt intensity, S was 108 kJ . g-1, and statistically indistinguisbable from the BMR estimate. During the first part of molt the coefficient of temperature dependence of the standard metabolic rate below thermoneutrality (SMR) increased from 0.050 to 0.070 W. degrees-C-1. The metabolizable energy required for maintenance (M.) increased with increasing body mass. The M. in males was higher than in females of the same body mass. The M. during molt was higher than during nonmolt episodes. The estimate for the cost of feather synthesis based on this difference was S = 117 kJ. g-1. The cost of feather synthesis in the kestrel is thus much lower than values reported for three passerines (230-835 kJ . g-1).

Thus, it is a key component in management and conservation of wild populations. In polygynous breeding species, group size influences the reproductive success of males and females, and hence it is essential to understand the environmental and demographic factors that shape the phenology of group size within populations. Here, we investigate harem size and its determinants using a 15-year dataset of annual harem size phenology-based metrics from a reintroduced population of wild Przewalski horses in Hortobagy National Park, Hungary. From the initial reintroduction of 21 animals in 1997, the population grew to 174 animals in 2012. During that same period, the number of harems increased from three to 23. Despite the 8-fold increase in population size, harem sizes remained stable, and variability among harems within years decreased. The annual phenological cycle of harem size was not consistent over the 15-year period, and the associated annual phenology-based metrics varied differently over the years. The best predictors of our phenology-based harem size metrics were adult sex ratio, annual adult mortality and annual mean number of harems, with some evidence that mean age of harem stallions and drought severity were contributing factors. Our findings reveal that complex interactions between demography, climate, and harem size can emerge in social animals. Taken together, our results demonstrate that intrinsic population processes can regulate group size even in the presence of non-stationary climatic conditions during periods of growth in human-introduced, semi-free ranging animal populations.",FEB,2024,14,2,,,e10865,10.1002/ece3.10865,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ece3.10865,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we report on recent trends in the timing of spring arrival and egg laying found within a western European Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca population. Mean egg laying date has advanced over the past 20 years in this population. The advancement in egg laying date was stronger than the advancement of spring arrival, suggesting that Pied Flycatchers are changing these stages of their annual cycle at different rates. It could be shown that selection for earlier breeding had increased. Hence, the observed adjustment in laying date did not match the advancement of spring. Our findings raise general questions about the adaptability of migratory birds to rapid environmental changes. Adaptive advancement of reproduction in response to increasing spring temperatures and to the concomitant advancement of food supply could be held back, because annual breeding and migration cycles are controlled primarily by endogenous rhythms and photoperiodic cues which do not relate to temperature. Migrants may have several options for arriving earlier on the breeding grounds, including an increase in migration speed, earlier departure from the wintering area or a shortening of migration distance. Changes in migratory behaviour could be accomplished either by phenotypic plasticity or by selection on different genotypes. Although descriptive field data provide compelling evidence for changes in, and possible constraints on, the timing of breeding and migration, their explanatory power in predicting the limits of adaptation remains restricted. We review recent experimental approaches, which explicitly test the relative roles of genetic versus environmental factors in the adaptation of life-cycle timing to global environmental changes.",,2002,90,3,369,378,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, rabbits are more sensitive to seasonal changes owing to their specific physiological characteristics, such as few sweat glands, thick coats of fur, high metabolic rate, and high growth rate. In this study, we investigated the variations in productivity, health status, and gut microbiota of meat rabbits reared in semi-confined conditions between summer and winter. In the summer season, the relative high ambient temperature and humidity could trigger disturbance of the gut microbiome, potential heat stress, reduced antioxidant defense, and increased inflammation risk, which consequently deteriorated production performance. In the winter season, changes in energy demand, photoperiod, and feeding pattern should be regarded as important factors that affect the productivity of meat rabbits. Based on our findings, we not only proposed several realistic strategies to alleviate the unfavorable influences of seasonal alterations on the productivity and well-being of meat rabbits but also pointed out the future directions for this study of molecular mechanisms in adaptation physiology.Abstract In this study, we investigated the variations in production performance, health status, and gut microbiota of meat rabbits raised in the semi-confined barn during summer and winter. Compared to summer, rabbits reared in winter possessed significantly higher slaughter weight and carcass weight. Rabbits fed in the summer were more vulnerable to different stressors, which led to increased protein levels of HSP90, IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-2, and concentrations of MDA, but declined GSH and SOD activities. Additionally, significant differences in gut microbial communities were observed. Compared to the winter, rabbits fed in the summer had significantly lower and higher alpha and beta diversity. Both Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobiota were the dominant phyla, and they accounted for greater proportions in the winter than in the summer. At lower microbial taxa levels, several seasonal differentially enriched microbes were identified, such as Akkermansia muciniphila, the Oscillospiraceae NK4A214 group, the Christensenellaceae R-7 group, Alistipes, and Muribaculaceae. Functional capacities linked to microbial proliferation, nutrient metabolism, and environmental adaptive responses exhibited significantly different abundances between summer and winter. Moreover, strong interactions among different indicators were presented. Based on our findings, we not only proposed several potential strategies to ameliorate the undesirable effects of seasonal changes on the productivity and health of meat rabbits but also underscored the directions for future mechanistic studies of adaptation physiology.",JAN,2024,14,1,,,113,10.3390/ani14010113,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ani14010113,,View Full Record in Web of Science

We consider two alternative hypotheses: consumers are constrained to adjust sufficiently to the lower trophic level, or prey species react more strongly than their predators to reduce predation. We discuss both hypotheses with our analyses of changes in phenology across four trophic levels: tree budburst, peak biomass of herbivorous caterpillars, breeding phenology of four insectivorous bird species and an avian predator. In our long-term study, we show that between 1988 and 2005, budburst advanced (not significantly) with 0.17 d yr(-1), while between 1985 and 2005 both caterpillars (0.75 d year(-1)) and the hatching date of the passerine species (range for four species: 0.36-0.50 d year(-1)) have advanced, whereas raptor hatching dates showed no trend. The caterpillar peak date was closely correlated with budburst date, as were the passerine hatching dates with the peak caterpillar biomass date. In all these cases, however, the slopes were significantly less than unity, showing that the response of the consumers is weaker than that of their food. This was also true for the avian predator, for which hatching dates were not correlated with the peak availability of fledgling passerines. As a result, the match between food demand and availability deteriorated over time for both the passerines and the avian predators. These results could equally well be explained by consumers' insufficient responses as a consequence of constraints in adapting to climate change, or by them trying to escape predation from a higher trophic level, or both. Selection on phenology could thus be both from matches of phenology with higher and lower levels, and quantifying these can shed new light on why some organisms do adjust their phenology to climate change, while others do not.",JAN,2009,78,1,73,83,,10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01458.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2656.2008.01458.x,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Genotype phenology is likely to play an essential role in such an effect. Yet, its response to elevated [CO2] and drought has not been studied before. Here we conducted a temperature-controlled glasshouse [CO2] enrichment experiment in which two wheat cultivars with differing maturity timings and life cycle lengths were grown under ambient (aCO(2) approximately 400 mu mol mol(-1)) and elevated (eCO(2) approximately 550 mu mol mol(-1)) [CO2]. The two cultivars, bred under dry and warm Mediterranean conditions, were well-watered or exposed to drought at 40% pot holding capacity. We aimed to explore water x [CO2] x genotype interaction in terms of phenology, physiology, and agronomic trait response. Our results show that eCO(2) had a significant effect on plants grown under drought. eCO(2) boosted the booting stage of the late-maturing genotype (cv. Ruta), thereby prolonging its booting-to-anthesis period by approximately 3 days (p < 0.05) while unaffecting the phenological timing of the early-maturing genotype (cv. Zahir). The prolonged period resulted in a much higher carbon assimilation rate, particularly during pre-anthesis (+87% for Ruta vs. +22% for Zahir under eCO(2)). Surprisingly, there was no eCO(2) effect on transpiration rate and grain protein content in both cultivars and under both water conditions. The higher photosynthesis (and transpiration efficiency) of Ruta was not translated into higher aboveground biomass or grain yield, whereas both cultivars showed a similar increase of approximately 20% in these two traits at eCO(2) under drought. Overall, Zahir, the cultivar that responded the least to eCO(2,) had a more efficient source-to-sink balance with a lower sink limitation than Ruta. The complex water x [CO2] x genotype interaction found in this study implies that future projections should account for multifactor interactive effects in modeling wheat response to future climate.",DEC,2022,45,12,3445,3461,,10.1111/pce.14430,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/pce.14430,SEP 2022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Individual shorebirds (red knots Calidris canutus islandica) were measured while in full summer and winter plumage as well as during peak of molt. Molt was associated with a 9.8% increase in average mass-independent basal metabolic rate (BMR) above nonmolting levels. Individual plasma levels of thyroxine (T-4) were correlated with individual rate of body feather renewal, confirming that T-4 is related to body molt but also showing that it is potentially regulating its rate. Across seasons, mass-independent average heat loss measured as conductance gradually declined with conductance during molt falling between measured values for summer and winter. During the molting period, however, body molting rate was positively correlated with thermal conductance, indicating that for a given ambient temperature below thermoneutrality, the fastest molting birds were losing more body heat. Across seasons, triiodothyronine (T-3), a hormone typically upregulated in response to a cold stimulus, was correlated with individual thermal conductance and BMR. We suggest that the increased heat loss of fast-molting birds leads to a cold-acclimatization response that may be partly responsible for the elevated BMR measured during molt. This could be mediated through a stimulatory effect of T-3 on BMR in response to increased heat loss. Our interpretation is supported by a positive relationship between the individual changes in conductance and the change in BMR from summer to the molting period.",MAR-APR,2009,82,2,129,142,,10.1086/596512,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/596512,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Under cyclical natural photoperiods, three of the four birds maintained cycles of body mass and contour and flight-feather molt somewhat comparable to that of free-living birds, though the multiple mass peaks characteristic of northward migration were replaced by a single period of high body mass; the mass peaks for southward migration appeared to be absent. Contour-feather molts between nonbreeding and breeding plumages were delayed, and the period of wing molt was longer than in free-living birds. Under constant photoperiods, clear circannual phenotype cycles were maintained. The length of the period with elevated body mass tripled but was partly compensated by a shortening of the duration of wing molt (which never coincided with high body masses).

During spring when biological reproductive processes begin in the temperate zones, regional climate variability can be immense and uncovering a non-linear biological response, such as fish recruitment to changing temperature regimes might be challenging. Using herring as a paradigm for a response of coastal spring productivity to regional climate drivers, we demonstrated how the annual timing of spawning periods can significantly affect the reproductive success of spring-spawning herring (Clupea harengus) in the western Baltic Sea. An investigation of spawning phenology in consecutive years indicated a temperature threshold range of 3.5-4.5 degrees C triggering initial spawning in the coastal zone. Based on this finding, we analyzed the timing of larval hatching peaks, larval survival and recruitment to the adult population relative to multi-decadal time-series of seasonal sea-surface temperatures. The results revealed that the late seasonal onset of cold periods the corresponding elongation of the period where larvae hatch from the eggs and early larval hatching peaks significantly reduced larval production in a coastal nursery area and finally lead to a reduced abundance of juveniles in the entire distribution area.

However, the overall consequences are still hard to predict because behaviour, genetic adaptation, habitat dependency and the impacts of fishing on species, result in complex species' responses that may be only partially explained by simple climate envelope predictions. There is a broad body of evidence that climatic fluctuations are playing an important role in changing fish distributions and abundances, which is discernible against the background of trends in abundance due to fishing. During warm periods, southern species have tended to become more prominent and northern species less abundant. However, the changes in distribution are often more complicated than might be expected from a simple climate envelope approach, partly due to ocean circulation patterns which create invasion routes for southern water species into the North Sea from the south and from the north via the continental shelf west of Britain and Ireland. The eventual population-scale impacts of ocean acidification on fish and shellfish are currently very difficult to predict. However, the scant evidence suggests that indirect food web effects arising from the enhanced sensitivity of calcifying planktonic organisms may be important, and the direct effect on fish sensory systems leading to subtle influences on behaviour with possible population-level implications are possible. In British waters, the lesser sandeel (Ammodytes marinus) is identified as being at particular risk from climate change. Owing to its strict association with coarse sandy sediments it is unable to adapt its distribution to compensate for warming sea temperatures. Sandeels are a key link in the food web, linking primary and zooplankton production to top predators.

In marine fishes, warming is expected to cause the advancement of a spring peak in larval occurrence or the delay of a fall peak. However, empirical evidence has not consistently upheld this broad prediction, implying that more nuanced hypotheses are needed. Our study investigates oceanic impacts on fish phenology by examining patterns in larval occurrence on the Northeast US continental shelf, one of the most rapidly warming regions of the global ocean. We use data from NOAA's Ecosystem Monitoring Program, which samples larval fish taxa across the shelf on a bimonthly basis. The sampling program began in 1999, thus documenting changes during a period of rapid warming. We calculated the central tendency of seasonal larval occurrence for 38 taxa and tested for temporal relationships with oceanic drivers thought to influence larval seasonality in other ecosystems. We did not find evidence for warming-related changes in larval phenology over the last 2 decades. Rather, we found high interannual variability in larval timing among many populations, especially those along the shelf break. Among examined factors, salinity maximum intrusions associated with Gulf Stream warm core rings showed the strongest explanatory power for variation in larval fish phenology. Additionally, the occurrence timing of highly variable larval populations overlapped with that of salinity maximum intrusions. Our results suggest that uniform phenological responses to warming are unlikely in this ecosystem, and that hydrodynamic processes connecting widely dispersed regions can strongly influence the phenology of fish.",JUL 4,2024,739,,157,172,,10.3354/meps14592,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps14592,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we used the commercial catch data from a local fisher over a 50-year period (1971-2020) to estimate western Baltic spring-spawning (WBSS) herring mean arrival time Q(50) (i.e., the week when 50% of the total fish catches had been made) at their spawning ground within the Kiel Fjord, southwest Baltic Sea, and the duration of the spawning season for each year. The relationship between the seawater temperature in the Kiel Bight and other environmental parameters (such as water salinity, North Atlantic and Atlantic multidecadal oscillations) and Q(50) was evaluated using a general linear model to test the hypothesis that fish arrived earlier after warm than cold winters. We also estimated the accumulated thermal time to Q(50) during gonadal development to estimate the effects of seawater temperature on the variations of Q(50). The results of this study revealed a dramatic decrease in herring catches within the Kiel Fjord since the mid-1990s, as documented for the whole southwestern Baltic Sea. Warmer winter seawater temperature was the only factor related to an earlier arrival (1 week for one January seawater temperature degree increase) of herring at their spawning ground. The relationship was found for the first time on week 52 of the year prior to spawning and was the strongest (50% of the variability explained) from the fourth week of January (8 weeks before the mean Q(50) among the studied years). A thermal constant to Q(50) (similar to 316 degrees C day) was found when temperatures were integrated from the 49th week of the year prior to spawning. These results indicate that seawater temperature enhanced the speed of gonadal maturation during the latest phases of gametogenesis, leading to an early fish arrival under warm conditions. The duration of the spawning season was elongated during warmer years, therefore potentially mitigating the effects of trophic mismatch when fish spawn early. The results of this study highlight the altering effects of climate change on the spawning activity of a migratory fish species in the Baltic Sea where fast global changes presage that in other coastal areas worldwide.",SEP,2024,105,3,766,778,,10.1111/jfb.15811,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jfb.15811,JUN 2024,View Full Record in Web of Science

In a seasonal environment, the timing of food abundance is one of the crucial factors to which birds should adapt their timing of reproduction. They can do this by shifting egg-laying date (LD), and also by changing other life-history characters that affect the period between laying of the eggs and hatching of the chicks. In a long-term study of the migratory Pied Flycatcher, we show that the peak of abundance of nestling food (caterpillars) has advanced during the last two decades, and that the birds advanced their LD. LD strongly correlates with the timing of the caterpillar peak, but in years with an early food peak the birds laid their eggs late relative to this food peak. In such years, the birds advance their hatching date by incubating earlier in the clutch and reducing the interval between laying the last egg to hatching of the first egg, thereby partly compensating for their relative late LD. Paradoxically, they also laid larger clutches in the years with an early food peak, and thereby took more time to lay (i.e. one egg per day). Clutch size therefore declined more strongly with LD in years with an early food peak. This stronger response is adaptive because the fitness of an egg declined more strongly with date in early than in late years. Clearly, avian life-history traits are correlated and Pied Flycatchers apparently optimize over the whole complex of the traits including LD, clutch size and the onset of incubation. Climate change will lead to changing selection pressures on this complex of traits and presumably the way they are correlated.",OCT,2005,11,10,1606,1613,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01038.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2005.01038.x,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Species from dry, open areas shortened their distance the most, species from wet, open areas the least, while woodland species fall in between the other two habitats. The decline in migration distance is likely due to climate change, as migration distances are negatively correlated with the Dutch temperatures in the winter of recovery.

Earlier arrival of long-distance migrants has been reported frequently [2, 3], but advancements of arrival and breeding were not always sufficient to match phenology at other trophic levels [4]. This has led to increased selection for early breeding [5] and severe population declines [6, 7]. This inadequate response has been explained by an inflexible start of migration, governed by cues unrelated to climate change, such as photoperiod [8]. It has been suggested that evolution at the genetic level is required for a change in photoresponsiveness [9]. Recently, such an evolutionary change in migration timing was suggested [10]. Here I show that timing of spring migration of pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca) has responded flexibly to climate change. Recovery dates during spring migration in Northern Africa advanced by ten days between 1980 and 2002, which was explained by improving Sahel rainfall and a phenotypic effect of birth date. The lack of advance on the breeding grounds most likely was due to environmental constraints during migration.

We model the trend in laying date for these 2 species -between 1980 and 2004 for most of their European breeding areas -by combining geographical variation in mean laying date, the effect of temperature on laying date, and spatial variation in temperature change. Starlings are predicted to have advanced breeding over most of their range, with the greatest advance in north-eastern Europe. In contrast, pied flycatchers have delayed their laying in northern Europe, but have advanced their laying in western and central Europe. The species differ because pied flycatchers lay their eggs 25 d later at each site than starlings, and temperatures during these 2 periods show different trends. Temperatures during migration have also changed differently for populations heading to different breeding areas. This was most pronounced for pied flycatchers; northern populations experience an increase in temperatures during migration, while more southern populations presently still migrate at temperatures similar to those experienced 25 yr ago. As a consequence the southern population may be constrained in adapting to climate change by low temperatures during migration. There is a large contrast in how circumstances during migration and at the breeding grounds have changed: populations that advanced breeding most were subjected to the lowest temperature increases during migration. The temporal and spatial variation in temperature change has important consequences on how migrants adapt to ongoing climate change.",DEC 31,2007,35,1-2,93,105,,10.3354/cr00716,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/cr00716,,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, such correlations, while useful for detecting long-term trends, are unable to provide a mechanism linking the physical environment and ecological processes. Here we evaluate the effects of the NAO on recruitment variability of rocky intertidal invertebrates in the North Atlantic examining two possible climate-related pathways. Using a highly conservative test we interpret associations with the NAO integrated over a season ( three months) as an indicator of atmospheric effects on newly settled recruits (NAO3), and the effects of the NAO integrated over six months (NAO6) as an indicator of changes in ocean circulation affecting patterns of larval transport. Through an extensive literature survey we found 13 time series, restricted to southwest Ireland and Britain and comprising five species, that could be used for statistical analysis. Significant correlations with NAO3, our proxy for atmospheric effects, were observed in the south-central domain of our study region ( southwest Ireland and south England). Significant correlations with NAO6, the proxy for ocean circulation effects, were detected on southwest Ireland. The associations were detected for three ( two barnacles and a topshell) at two sites. These results suggest that the NAO can have effects on the recruitment of intertidal invertebrates through different pathways linked to climate and be distributed heterogeneously in space. Based on previous evidence and the sign and geographic location of significant correlations, we suggest that winter NAO effects are likely to occur as a result of effects on the survival of early life stages settling during spring or through changes in phenology. Our results argue that a combination of modeling and synthesis can be used to generate hypotheses regarding the effects of climate on recruitment and aid in the design of field-based tests of explicit ecological mechanisms.",NOV,2008,89,11,S81,S90,,10.1890/08-0635.1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1890/08-0635.1,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here we show that adaptation to climate change in a long-distance migrant is constrained by the timing of its migratory journey. For long-distance migrants climate change may advance the phenology of their breeding areas, but the timing of some species' spring migration relies on endogenous rhythms that are not affected by climate change(8). Thus, the spring migration of these species will not advance even though they need to arrive earlier on their breeding grounds to breed at the appropriate time. We show that the migratory pied flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca has advanced its laying date over the past 20 years. This temporal shift has been insufficient, however, as indicated by increased selection for earlier breeding over the same period. The shift is hampered by its spring arrival date, which has not advanced.

Climate warming and general increase in precipitation with strong temporal and spatial variations have happened in China during the past century. Such changes in climate associated with the human disturbances have influenced natural ecosystems of China, leading to the advanced plant phenology in spring, lengthened growing season of vegetation, modified composition and geographical pattern of vegetation, especially in ecotone and tree-lines, and the increases in vegetation cover, vegetation activity and net primary productivity. Increases in temperature, changes in precipitation regime and CO2 concentration enrichment will happen in the future in China according to climate model simulations. The projected climate scenarios (associated with land use changes again) will significantly influence Chinese ecosystems, resulting in a northward shift of all forests, disappearance of boreal forest from northeastern China, new tropical forests and woodlands move into the tropics, an eastward shift of grasslands (expansion) and deserts (shrinkage), a reduction in alpine vegetation and an increase in net primary productivity of most vegetation types. Ecosystems in northern and western parts of China are more vulnerable to climate changes than those in eastern China, while ecosystems in the east are more vulnerable to land use changes other than climate changes. Such assessment could be helpful to address the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC Article 2).",MAR,2011,11,,S49,S64,,10.1007/s10113-010-0170-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10113-010-0170-0,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Long-term phenological observations are critically important for tracking and communicating these changes. The phenological observation network across Germany is operated by the National Meteorological Service with a major contribution from volunteering activities. However, the number of observers has strongly decreased for the last decades, possibly resulting in increasing uncertainties when extracting reliable phenological information from map interpolation. We studied uncertainties in interpolated maps from decreasing phenological records, by comparing long-term trends based on grid-based interpolated and station-wise observed time series, as well as their correlations with temperature. Interpolated maps in spring were characterized by the largest spatial variabilities across Bavaria, Germany, with respective lowest interpolated uncertainties. Long-term phenological trends for both interpolations and observations exhibited mean advances of -0.2 to -0.3 days year(-1) for spring and summer, while late autumn and winter showed a delay of around 0.1 days year(-1). Throughout the year, temperature sensitivities were consistently stronger for interpolated time series than observations. Such a better representation of regional phenology by interpolation was equally supported by satellite-derived phenological indices. Nevertheless, simulation of observer numbers indicated that a decline to less than 40% leads to a strong decrease in interpolation accuracy. To better understand the risk of declining phenological observations and to motivate volunteer observers, a Shiny app is proposed to visualize spatial and temporal phenological patterns across Bavaria and their links to climate change-induced temperature changes.",AUG,2021,65,8,1377,1390,,10.1007/s00484-021-02110-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00484-021-02110-3,MAR 2021,View Full Record in Web of Science

We also investigated how hares in Pennsylvania altered movement rates and resting spot selection to cope with variable winter temperatures. Hares from Pennsylvania had shorter, less dense, and less white winter coats than their northern counterparts, suggesting lower coat insulation. Hares in the southern population had lower pelage temperatures, indicating that they produced less heat than those in the northern population. In addition, hares in Pennsylvania did not select for resting spots that offered thermal advantages, but selected locations offering visual obstruction from predators.

High population growth rates over summer (lambda = 1.83-8.00) were followed by large population declines over winter (lambda = 0.16-0.82). Young-of-the-year hares tended to gain mass over winter, while adult hares tended to loose body mass. The average mass of adult hares was significantly lower during the low phase of the cycle compared with when hares were abundant. Overwinter survival of juveniles relative to adults decreased strongly as a function of the frequency of snowfall events. However, effects of temperature and precipitation on hare demography were season dependent and appear to act as modifiers of the primary controls over population dynamics (predation and food) rather than as direct sources of mortality. The rapid changes in green-up and snow-up in interior Alaska may affect forage conditions as well as the timing of molt in snowshoe hares.

The country is not spared from the adverse effects of climate change which play a substantial role in altering the ecosystem and have a ripple effect on food security. Wild fruits and vegetables have been identified to be underutilized despite the country's struggle in nourishing its population. This paper reviewed the impacts of climate change on the phenology, physiology, and economic benefits of wild fruits and vegetables in South Africa. Furthermore, spatial-based data was used to evaluate the possible productivity of wild fruits and vegetables through land use/land cover (LULC) assessment. The result showed that South Africa had varied vegetation and land cover dynamics. For example, Northern Cape and Western Cape Provinces are dominated by shrubland and barren land, thus unsuitable for fruit and vegetable production. In contrast, Limpopo, North-West, Mpumalanga, Gauteng, Free State, some parts of KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape Provinces are covered with grassland and cultivated areas which made them good for vegetable farming and potential ground for wild fruit and vegetable cultivation. Thus, there is a need to develop cultivation strategies for edible wild fruits and vegetables with known nutritional characteristics to expand knowledge about nutritional benefits and options in utilizing the wild species. This will boost the country's economy, help to improve diet, and can play a crucial role in food security.

We explore the demographic consequences of skewed sex ratios on the viability of a tuatara population characterized by low genetic diversity. We studied the rare species of tuatara (Sphenodon guntheri) on the 4 ha North Brother Island in New Zealand over two nesting seasons and captured 477 individuals, with a 60% male bias in the adult population. Females first breed at 15 years and have extremely low rates of gravidity, producing clutches of three to eight eggs every 9 years. Simulations of the population using population viability analysis showed that the current population is expected to persist for at least 2000 years at hatchling sex ratios of up to 75% male, but populations with 85% male hatchlings are expected to become extinct within approximately 300 years (some eight generations). Incorporation of inbreeding depression increased the probability of extinction under male biased sex ratios, with no simulated populations surviving at hatchling sex ratios >75% male. Because recent models have predicted that climate change could lead to the production of all male S. guntheri hatchlings by 2085, we examined whether periodic intervention to produce mixed or female biased sex ratios would allow the population to survive if only males were produced in natural nests. We show that intervention every 2-3 years could buffer the effects of climate change on population sex ratios, but translocation to cooler environs might be more cost-effective. Climate change threatens tuatara populations because neither modified nesting behaviour nor adaptive response of the pivotal temperature can modify hatchling sex ratios fast enough in species with long generation intervals.",JAN,2010,16,1,60,72,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01964.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01964.x,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Rhythms of contour feather and flight feather moult and of body mass change persisted throughout the experiment in most birds, and showed two cycles over this period. At the beginning of the experiment the six birds were synchronous, but in the course of the experiment inter-individual differences in their circannual periods developed. Desynchronisation between the rhythms of moult and mass change in the same individual occurred in some birds. The first cycle was delayed with respect to the natural schedule, while the second cycle had a duration of about a year on average. Since the second cycle was less well expressed than the first cycle in most birds, the endogenous rhythm is likely to be damped rather than self-sustained.

Data from Zackenberg show that timing of snowmelt, the length of the growing season and summer temperature are the basic variables that determine the phenology of flowering and primary production upon which the herbivores depend, and snow may be the most important climatic factor affecting the different trophic levels and the interactions between them. Hence, the spatio-temporal distribution of snow, as well as thawing events during winter, may have considerable effects on the herbivores by influencing their access to forage in winter. During winter, musk oxen prefer areas with a thin snow-cover, where food is most easily accessible. In contrast, lemmings seek areas with thick snow-cover, which provide protection from the cold and some predators. Therefore, lemmings may be affected directly by both the timing of onset and the duration of winter snow-cover. Musk oxen significantly reduced the productivity of arctic willow, while high densities of collared lemmings during winter reduced the production of mountain averts flowers in the following summer. Under a deep snow-layer scenario, climate and the previous year's density of musk oxen had a negative effect on the present year's production of arctic willow. Previous year's primary production of arctic willow, in turn, significantly affected the present year's density of musk oxen positively. Climatic factors that affect primary production of plants indirectly, influenced the spatial distribution of herbivores. Additionally, snow distribution directly affected the distribution of herbivores, and hence, in turn, affected the plant community by selective feeding and locally reducing the standing biomass of forage plants. Although only few moth larvae were observed at Zackenberg, these had in some cases important local effects owing to their foraging on up to 60% of the flower stands on individual mountain avens. UV-B radiation induces plants to produce secondary plant metabolites, which protects tissues against UV-B damage. This results in lower production of anti-herbivore defenses and improves the nutritional quality of the food plants. Zackenberg data on the relationship between variation in density of collared lemmings in winter and UV-B radiation indirectly supports this mechanism, which was originally proposed on the basis of a positive relationship between UV-B radiation and reproduction in two sub-arctic species of hares (Lepus timidus and Lepus americanus).",,2008,40,,275,298,,10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00012-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2504(07)00012-8,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Evidence of these effects have increased over recent decades; however, we still have a poor understanding of the possible outcomes of their interplay across global climatic gradients, hindering our ability to accurately predict the consequences of climate change in populations and ecosystems. We examined the effect that changes in biogeography can have on the life-history traits of two of the most successful range-extending fish species in the world: the tropical rabbitfishes Siganus fuscescens and Siganus rivulatus. Both species have established abundant populations at higher latitudes in the northern and southern hemispheres and have been identified as important ecological engineers with the potential to alter the community structure of seaweed forests (Laminariales and Fucales) in temperate regions. Life-history trait information from across their global distribution was compiled from the published literature and meta-analyses were conducted to assess changes in (i) the onset and duration of reproductive periods, (ii) size at maturity, (iii) fecundity, (iv) growth rates, (v) maximum body sizes and (vi) longevity in populations at the leading edge of range expansion in relation to sea surface temperature and primary productivity (a common proxy for nutritional resource levels). Populations at highest latitudes had shortened their reproductive periods and reduced growth rates, taking longer to reach sexual maturity and maximum sizes, but compensated this with higher fecundity per length class and longer lifespans than populations in warmer environments. Low primary productivity and temperature in the Mediterranean Sea resulted in lower growth rates and body sizes for S. rivulatus, but also lower length at maturity, increasing life-time reproductive output. The results suggest that plasticity in the phenology and life-history traits of range-expanding species would be important to enhance their fitness in high latitude environments, facilitating their persistence and possible further poleward expansions. Quantifying the magnitude and direction of these responses can improve our understanding and ability to forecast species redistributions and its repercussions in the functioning of temperate ecosystems.",AUG,2022,91,8,1666,1678,,10.1111/1365-2656.13739,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2656.13739,MAY 2022,View Full Record in Web of Science

Leaf production and shoot elongation were rapid (up to 28 leaves/week) and or short duration (1-3 weeks). Conversely, shoot diameter increment was gradual and continued from February to December. Two leaf cohorts were produced per year and the second leaf cohort was only a small proportion of the first cohort. Most leaf production, 80-90%, occurred on nodes older than one year (brachyplasts). Developmentally, leaves remained juvenile for a very short period and subsequently remained mature for about 5 months. Leaf survivorship of second cohort leaves was significantly shorter than of first cohort leaves. Leaf herbivores removed about 40% of the leaf production before the leaves matured. Following leaf maturation few leaves were eaten. Insects also ate new shoot meristems, halting shoot elongation in 100% of new shoots during 1981 and 1982. Significant losses (35% of shoots) were the result of herbivory by rodents and rabbits. Such herbivory occurred later in the year than leaf herbivory. The rapid leaf production and new shoot elongation may be an adaptation to minimise losses to leaf herbivores. Generally, the seasonal progression of growth in Prosopis glandulosa was uncoupled from the influences of precipitation or temperature. Also, the phenological state of the leaves in combination with their physiology controlled xylem pressure potential, rather than the reverse. Only very few statistical correlations could be made between phenology and climatic conditions.",NOV,1987,13,3,217,229,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Annual shifts in birth peaks were significantly negatively correlated with the preceding wet season rainfall. Varying the timing and synchrony of births and natality rates are widespread but little understood adaptations of ungulates to climatic extremes. Climate change heightens the need for advancing this understanding because increasing frequency and severity of droughts is likely to decouple phenology of breeding in seasonally breeding ungulates from that in their food plants.

However, feather insulation is essential for avian species breeding at northern latitudes, where cold conditions or even snowstorms can occur during the breeding season. In altricial arctic species, increased heat loss caused by poor feather insulation during growth could be counter-adaptative as it creates additional energy demands for thermoregulation. Using flow-through respirometry, we compared resting metabolic rate at thermoneutrality (RMRt), summit metabolic rate (M-sum) and heat loss (conductance) in adult and juvenile snow buntings on their summer and winter grounds. In summer, when buntings are in the Arctic, juveniles had a 12% higher RMRt, likely due to unfinished growth, and lost 14% more heat to the environment than adults. This pattern may result from juveniles fledging early to avoid predation at the cost of lower feather insulation. Surprisingly, an opposite pattern was observed at lower latitudes on their wintering grounds. Although they showed no difference in RMRt and M-sum, adults were losing 12% more heat than juveniles. We suggest that this difference is due to poorer insulative property of plumage in adults stemming from energetic and time constraints encountered during their post-breeding molt. High plumage insulation in first-winter juvenile buntings could be adaptive to reduce thermoregulatory demands and maximize survival in the first winter of life, while adults could use behavioral strategies to compensate for their greater rate of heat loss.",OCT,2023,193,5,557,568,,10.1007/s00360-023-01502-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00360-023-01502-8,JUN 2023,View Full Record in Web of Science

The expansion has occurred both within the Arctic as well as by the colonization of temperate areas. Studies of performance of individuals in expanding populations provide information on how well species can adapt to novel environments and global warming. We, therefore, studied the availability of high quality food as well as timing of reproduction, wing moult, fledgling production and postfledging survival of individually marked geese in three recently established populations: one Arctic (Barents Sea) and two temperate (Baltic, North Sea). In the Barents Sea population, timing of hatching was synchronized with the peak in food availability and there was strong stabilizing selection. Although birds in the Baltic and North Sea populations bred 6-7 weeks earlier than Arctic birds, timing of hatching was late in relation to the peak in food availability, and there was moderate to strong directional selection for early breeding. In the Baltic, absolute timing of egg laying advanced considerably over the 20-year study period, but advanced little relative to spring phenology, and directional selection on lay date increased over time. Wing moult of adults started only 2-4 weeks earlier in the temperate populations than in the Arctic. Synchronization between fledging of young and end of wing moult decreased in the temperate populations. Arctic-breeding geese may gradually accumulate body stores from the food they encounter during spring migration, which allows them to breed relatively early and their young to use the peak of the Arctic food resources. By contrast, temperate-breeding birds are not able to acquire adequate body stores from local resources early enough, that is before the quality of food for their young starts to decrease. When global temperatures continue to rise, Arctic-breeding barnacle geese might encounter similar problems.",MAY,2009,15,5,1057,1071,,10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01804.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2008.01804.x,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we offer thermal time models (models measuring time in temperature units) as tools to understand the spawning dynamics of small pelagic fish, such as Pacific herring Clupea pallasii. We hypothesised that thermal time explains the annual timing of spawning of Pacific herring across space and time. By testing this hypothesis, we identified developmental constants (thermal constants of spawning) that can be used to make spawning time predictions. We examined spatio-temporal changes in Pacific herring spawning time over a 69 yr period (1941-2010) across 6 regions off British Columbia (BC), Canada. We estimated the degree-days (DD, degrees C-days) from the onset of gonadal maturation to spawning by combining spawning time estimates with distribution-specific temperature estimates. We then fitted models to explore how DD to spawning can be used to explain observed spawning time patterns across space and time and identified temperature-independent sources of variability (e.g. adaptive differences among regions, spawner size). We found that, even though Pacific herring often spawned similar to 5 d later with each increasing degree in latitude, the average thermal time in DD to spawning was similar to 1700 degrees C-days. We also found that DD to spawning explains linear variation in spawning time across years for some regions of the BC Pacific herring. Thermal time models can aid in predictions of environmental responses and forecasts of life-history phenology in a changing climate.",JUL 30,2024,741,,237,249,,10.3354/meps14569,http://dx.doi.org/10.3354/meps14569,,View Full Record in Web of Science

The spatial and temporal extents of these effects are important to inform models of population dynamics, environmental risk assessments, restoration efforts, and predictions of climate change effects. A hypothesis of delayed gametogenesis for oysters at low salinity sites was tested relative to their higher salinity counterparts in downstream experimental cages. In 2018, the timing of gametogenesis and spawning was observed June-August for 2-year-old oysters from three distinct ancestries (native, hatchery, aquaculture), outplanted at age 1 month along the salinity gradient (3-30 psu) of a temperate estuary. A second season of data was collected in 2019 from a 3-year-old aquaculture line and mixed-age native adult oysters dredged and transplanted 1 year prior. Dermo was tested in 2019 and prevalence was 1.3% (n = 240). Gametogenesis and spawning were retarded for all ancestries at low salinity relative to higher salinity sites during July and August. The reverse pattern was found in June, with low salinity sites having more advanced gonad index than at a high salinity site. This difference in average gonad index was 2.65 vs 1.46, respectively, for the native line and 2.62 vs 2.08 for aquaculture. Low salinity seemed to not only induce earlier gametogenesis in June, but also extended the reproductive season relative to higher salinity sites. Among oyster ancestries, the aquaculture line stood out as having 30-48% lower gametogenic synchrony within sites, but only in 2018. Because the native oysters used in this study have been restricted to low salinity conditions for many generations, demonstration of their reproductive plasticity across salinities is notable and broadens the range of potential future restoration strategies.",MAY,2023,46,3,707,722,,10.1007/s12237-022-01163-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12237-022-01163-w,JAN 2023,View Full Record in Web of Science

Resource availability can influence animals' physical condition and population growth. However, much less is known on its effects on reproductive performance and sexual selection. In this study, we assessed the impact of three environmental factors related to climate change (rainfall, temperature and vegetation index) on Iberian red deer Cervus elaphus hispanicus reproductive timing and sexual behaviour, and their effects on the opportunity for sexual selection in the population. We measured rutting phenology as rut peak date, the intensity of male rutting activity as roaring rate, and the opportunity for sexual selection from the distribution of females among harem holding males in Donana Biological Reserve (Southwest Spain), from data of daily observations collected during the rut over a period of 25 years. For this study period, we found a trend for less raining and hence poorer environmental conditions, which associated with delayed rutting season and decreased rutting intensity, but that appeared to favour a higher degree of polygyny and opportunity for sexual selection, all these relationships being modulated by population density and sex ratio.

In these strongly seasonal environments, small herbivorous mammals may have a significant role in determining the trajectory of ecosystem transitions from one state to another. Arctic ground squirrels Urocitellus parryii are a key component of northern terrestrial food webs and are considered ecosystem engineers, exerting a large impact on their habitat through bioturbation. We review and synthesize diverse information about current and past distribution and density of arctic ground squirrels, their physiology and ecological interactions with other species. Factors that appear to affect the distribution and abundance of arctic ground squirrels include increasing temperatures, changes in flooding probability, permafrost thaw, shifting phenology, habitat change, new predators and invasive diseases. Increases in the distribution and density of arctic ground squirrels in northern latitudes and high altitudes could accelerate ecosystem change through facilitation of disturbance-tolerant species, while decreases in southern and milder climates could remove an important agent of disturbance and prey item. Despite their pervasive ecological influence throughout most of their range, arctic ground squirrels are underrepresented in ecological research, based on a comparison of the number of publications about arctic ground squirrels with the number about other species of the same genus, and about other arctic herbivores. The widespread distribution of arctic ground squirrels, along with their potential to exacerbate and alter trajectories of ecosystem change under global warming, makes them a valuable indicator of ecosystem change and therefore a candidate for increased monitoring.",JUL,2013,43,3,238,255,,10.1111/j.1365-2907.2012.00220.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2907.2012.00220.x,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Thus, thermoregulation should be related to body size, however, generalizable patterns are still unclear. Domestic dogs are a diverse species of endothermic mammals, including a 44-fold difference in body size. Previous work in sedentary dogs has determined that body size and other morphological variables tend to predict the thermoregulation of exercising pet dogs. Here, we aimed to address three questions: (1) whether thermoregulatory differences in domestic dogs across seasons are dictated strictly by external environmental temperatures or if individual thermal acclimation is affected by seasonal temperature variation, even indoors; (2) whether athleticism (or training experience) affects or changes thermoregulation in dogs, as it does in humans; and (3) whether thermoregulation in domestic dogs has a genetic basis. We obtained tympanic membrane (Tear) temperatures and thermal images to measure the rate of temperature change in the eyes, mouth, and nose of athletic dogs following an indoor agility trial. Additionally, we used image analysis to determine body morphology differences. We found body mass to play a strong role in thermoregulation in winter trials (Tmouth p = 0.017, Tnose p = 0.052) but a less determinate role in summer trials. We found distinct differences in thermoregulation patterns between winter and summer. Particularly, coat morphology and length may play different roles in thermoregulation across seasons. Additionally, we found that rates of mouth temperature change differ by an interaction between environmental temperature and training experience (p = 0.044), suggesting seasonal thermoregulation patterns in dogs depend on relative athleticism. Lastly, we found important genetic predictors of temperature change rate, such as GORAB and IGF1, as well as others that exert influence over body size, mitochondrial function, or coat characteristics. These genetic markers indicate markers similar to our whole-animal physiological results. Overall, our data suggest that domestic dogs demonstrate thermal acclimation across seasons, that athleticism changes thermoregulatory patterns in domestic dogs, and that body size-related genes are associated with thermoregulation in dogs.",2025 JAN 16,2025,,,,,,10.1002/jez.2899,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/jez.2899,JAN 2025,View Full Record in Web of Science

A lower food richness and a more generalist diet are expected as altitude increases, with higher diet diversity and a shift to browsing as food availability decreases seasonally. With broad diets and ecological adaptability, Lepus europaeus is a non-native herbivore inhabiting Andean altitudinal gradients. Diet and vegetation were analyzed using microhistological analysis and point-quadrat transects at six sampling sites, representative of altitudinal phytogeographic belts. The diet included 67 of the 109 species present in the vegetation. Lepus europaeus proved to be an intermediate feeder with a generalist and selective diet. Following the prediction for altitudinal gradients, dietary generalism increased as plant cover and diversity decreased with altitude. Differences in plant phenology and toxins justified changes in food preferences, from shrubs at the summit to grasses at lower altitudes. Seasonal changes in diet diversity were consistent with different hypotheses depending on altitude. The tundra climate at the summit determined a strong phenological decline and food scarcity during winter, when the less diverse diet was more focused on a preferred shrub, following the selective quality hypothesis. With a milder climate at lower altitudes, the winter increase in diet diversity, with inclusion of avoided shrubs, agrees with the food abundance hypothesis. Climate severity, food shortage, plant phenology, and secondary compounds are relevant for explaining the feeding strategy of European hares in these mountain environments.",JAN,2017,62,1,75,87,,10.1007/s13364-016-0288-7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13364-016-0288-7,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Populations of the smallest avian herbivores, such as ducks, are either stable or have peaked and are now in decline, whereas numbers of larger herbivores ( geese and swans) continue to increase and barnacle and greylag geese now breed in the Netherlands, in addition to northern sites. During the northerly spring migration, stop- over sites, mostly in the agricultural regions of eastern Europe and Scandinavia, lie between the 3 and 6 degrees C mean daily temperature isotherms in April, temperatures at which grasses start to grow, where flooding of riparian wetlands frequently occurs and fertilizers are applied to farmland. However, the restructuring of agricultural practices in an enlarged EU is likely to affect water bird populations and their migration routes. The reduced use of N in the Netherlands is predicted to constrain population growth, especially of the smallest avian herbivores with their high basal metabolic rates, because of the declining food quality of grass leaves.

We first described the dominant modes of physical and biological (zooplankton) variability using Principal Components Analyses of 40 variables. Two principal modes of variability were identified, a long-term mode (15-20yr) associated with a warming of the GSL and a second mode describing alternating cold and warm periods at a higher frequency (5-10yr). A strong link between physical forcing and the dynamics of zooplankton species known to be important for mackerel was shown. Second, a set of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) was developed to explore how these environmental variations could influence mackerel condition (Fulton's K) and recruitment success (R-s). Optimal GAMs including variations in abundance, species composition and phenology of key copepods improved model performance by 40-50% relative to those considering only physical environmental conditions. The results are consistent with the match-mismatch hypothesis and illustrate the key role of zooplankton dynamics in modulating variations in mackerel K and R-s. Finally, this study showed that large variations in R-s could be caused by varying environmental conditions independently of the influence of stock biomass.

Experimental plots were established in stands of Sitka spruce over elevational gradients in two commercial forest plantations, and the abundance and emergence times of key bark beetle species were assessed over a 3-year period using flight interception traps. The air temperature difference between the lowest and highest experimental plot in each forest was consistently >1 degrees C throughout the 3-year period.

The results of the study indicated that, under the projected future climate warming scenarios, monoculture Sitka spruce stands at low elevations may potentially be more vulnerable to significant outbreak events from existing or invasive bark beetle species.

Using genomic data collected from spawning aggregations of Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii) across 1600 km of coastline, we show that reproductive timing drives population structure in these pelagic fish. Within a specific spawning season, we observed isolation by distance, indicating that gene flow is also geographically limited over our study area. These results emphasize the importance of considering both seasonal and spatial variation in spawning when delineating management units for herring. On several chromosomes, we detected linkage disequilibrium extending over multiple Mb, suggesting the presence of chromosomal rearrangements. Spawning phenology was highly correlated with polymorphisms in several genes, in particular SYNE2, which influences the development of retinal photoreceptors in vertebrates. SYNE2 is probably within a chromosomal rearrangement in Pacific herring and is also associated with spawn timing in Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus).

Hantaviruses more specifically cause thousands of human disease cases annually worldwide, while understanding and predicting human hantavirus epidemics pose numerous unsolved challenges. Nephropathia epidemica (NE) is a human infection caused by Puumala virus, which is naturally carried and shed by bank voles (Myodes glareolus). The objective of this study was to develop a method that allows model-based predicting 3months ahead of the occurrence of NE epidemics. Two data sets were utilized to develop and test the models. These data sets were concerned with NE cases in Finland and Belgium. In this study, we selected the most relevant inputs from all the available data for use in a dynamic linear regression (DLR) model. The number of NE cases in Finland were modelled using data from 1996 to 2008. The NE cases were predicted based on the time series data of average monthly air temperature (degrees C) and bank voles' trapping index using a DLR model. The bank voles' trapping index data were interpolated using a related dynamic harmonic regression model (DHR). Here, the DLR and DHR models used time-varying parameters. Both the DHR and DLR models were based on a unified state-space estimation framework. For the Belgium case, no time series of the bank voles' population dynamics were available. Several studies, however, have suggested that the population of bank voles is related to the variation in seed production of beech and oak trees in Northern Europe. Therefore, the NE occurrence pattern in Belgium was predicted based on a DLR model by using remotely sensed phenology parameters of broad-leaved forests, together with the oak and beech seed categories and average monthly air temperature (degrees C) using data from 2001 to 2009. Our results suggest that even without any knowledge about hantavirus dynamics in the host population, the time variation in NE outbreaks in Finland could be predicted 3months ahead with a 34% mean relative prediction error (MRPE). This took into account solely the population dynamics of the carrier species (bank voles). The time series analysis also revealed that climate change, as represented by the vegetation index, changes in forest phenology derived from satellite images and directly measured air temperature, may affect the mechanics of NE transmission. NE outbreaks in Belgium were predicted 3months ahead with a 40% MRPE, based only on the climatological and vegetation data, in this case, without any knowledge of the bank vole's population dynamics. In this research, we demonstrated that NE outbreaks can be predicted using climate and vegetation data or the bank vole's population dynamics, by using dynamic data-based models with time-varying parameters. Such a predictive modelling approach might be used as a step towards the development of new tools for the prevention of future NE outbreaks.",NOV,2013,60,7,461,477,,10.1111/zph.12021,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/zph.12021,,View Full Record in Web of Science

During the second half of the 20(th) century, not only did Northern Lapwing Vanellus vanellus experience an increase in spring temperatures, their meadow habitat also changed dramatically due to agricultural intensification. In The Netherlands, eggs of Lapwing have been collected for consumption for ages, especially in the province of Frysl (a) over capn, and as the finding of the first egg of the season has been an important social event till today, first egg dates are archived. Here we present data on the dates at which the first egg of the season was found in Frysl (a) over capn, in 1897-2003. Somewhat to our surprise we found that the advance in the first egg date was primarily explained by increasing spring temperatures. Lapwings also laid earlier after wet winters, with little variance remaining to be explained by habitat changes. Still, at the same spring temperatures and winter rainfall, the first egg was laid on average three days earlier in 2000 compared with 1900. A complementary dataset on the date that the first egg was found in the loth successive Friesian municipality confirmed the strong effect of temperature and the additional effect of winter rainfall. The number of days between the first egg date for the province and the 10(th) municipality yielded a measure of breeding synchrony. The start of egg laying was more synchronous during cold springs. Our analysis thus shows that Lapwing laying date was primarily affected by climatic factors rather than by the considerable changes in breeding habitat.",SPR,2005,93,1,79,88,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This idea (the food constraint hypothesis) stimulated field experiments with supplementary food, and also catalyzed analysis of the seasonal trends of fitness for both parents and offspring. Most experiments resulted in minor advances in laying date hinting that other factors are also important, and the fitness comparisons underlined the view that laying date must be viewed as a trade-off between opposing seasonal trends affecting parents (later is better) and offspring (the earlier the better). Experimental advances of laying have revealed fitness costs (lowered survival) for the parent(s) counteracting the higher output of young. Laying date is thus best considered as an individually based compromise (individual optimisation hypothesis), with exact timing subject to local environmental control. Recent analyses of climate change (warming trend in spring) confirm responses in many but not all bird species, and where detailed data are available the advance documented in laying date seems often to fall short of the shift in the food peak. Migrants in particular may be unable to speed up their spring travels, in some species on account of time conflicts with moult. The larger bodied migrants breeding in the Arctic face severe time constraints as they must lay relatively early on the snowy tundra. Postulated to rely on endogenous stores to lay eggs and incubate them, finer resolution of their travel schedules by means of satellite telemetry combined with investigation of the isotopic signature of body tissues, eggs, and food sources show a mixed strategy to prevail: transport what you can ('capital') and supplement this on the breeding grounds ('income'). Stores acquired at stopover sites are of crucial importance for both survival and breeding and any'mismatch' caused by uncoupling of rates of climate change along the migratory pathway may have profound effects on the population level.",,2006,94,3,305,322,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Germlings and new shoots emerged in great quantities in March when temperature was near 0 degrees C and daylength 10-13 h. All nine intertidal species on the Murman coast exhibit a period of rapid vegetative growth in early spring, at temperatures far below the optimum temperatures in at least five of them for which experimental evidence from the literature is available. The increasing light level in early spring is probably responsible for this growth. In six of them (Ulvaria obscura, Monostroma grevillei, Chorda filum, Chordaria flagelliformis, Stictyosiphon tortilis, Dumontia contorta) summer peaks of reproduction are apparently responsible for the summer decline of the thalli. The last five of these six have heteromorphic life histories in which microthallus stages are thought to ensure approximate synchronization of early spring recruitment (for instance by short day induction of microthallus development at autumnal temperatures, as in D. contorta and M. grevillei). In one species (Membranoptera alata), with an isomorphic diplohaplontic life history, early spring recruitment is thought to be ensured by the release of tetraspores and carpospores in winter. Earlier expectations that southern species would shift their reproduction to the summer near their northern distribution boundary were not confirmed. The general conclusion is that each of the nine species has approximately the same seasonal cycle of growth and reproduction in various parts of its geographic range, with only minor shifts from spring towards summer (but precise data on seasonal cycles elsewhere are scarce). This suggests that there may be subtle differences in temperatures and photoperiods triggering the onset of reproduction; this aspect needs further experimental testing of strains from the Murman coast.",MAR,1996,39,2,83,93,,10.1515/botm.1996.39.1-6.83,http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/botm.1996.39.1-6.83,,View Full Record in Web of Science

In particular, water temperature is positively correlated with the development of many parasites and pathogenic bacteria, increasing the risk of infection and diseases during summer. Interannual temperature fluctuations are likely to alter host parasite interactions, which may result in profound impacts on sensitive ecosystems. In this context we investigated the parasite and bacterial Vibrionaceae communities of four common small fish species (three-spined stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus, Atlantic herring Clupea harengus, European sprat Sprattus sprattus and lesser sand eel Ammodytes tobianus) in the Northern Wadden Sea over a period of two years. Overall, we found significantly increased relative diversities of infectious species at higher temperature differentials. On the taxon-specific level some macroparasite species (trematodes, nematodes) showed a shift in infection peaks that followed the water temperatures of preceding months, whereas other parasite groups showed no effects of temperature differentials on infection parameters. Our results show that even subtle changes in seasonal temperatures may shift and modify the phenology of parasites as well as opportunistic pathogens that can have far reaching consequences for sensitive ecosystems.

Long-distance migrants must travel before they start breeding, and conditions at the wintering grounds and during migration may affect travelling speed and hence arrival and breeding dates. These effects are to a large extent determined by climate variables such as rainfall and temperature, and need to be identified to predict how well species can adapt to climate change. In this paper we analyse effects of vegetation growth on the wintering grounds and sites en route on the annual timing of breeding of 17 populations of Pied Flycatchers Ficedula hypoleuca studied between 1982-2000. Timing of breeding was largely correlated with local spring temperatures, supplemented by striking effects of African vegetation and NAO. Populations differed in the effects of vegetation growth on the wintering grounds, and on their northern African staging grounds, as well as ecological conditions in Europe as measured by the winter NAO. In general, early breeding populations (low altitude, western European populations) bred earlier in years with more vegetation in the Northern Sahel zone, as well as in Northern Africa. In contrast, late breeding populations (high altitude and northem and eastern populations) advanced their breeding dates when circumstances in Europe were more advanced (high NAO). Thus, timing of breeding in most Pied Flycatcher populations not only depends upon local circumstances, but also on conditions encountered during travelling, and these effects differ across populations dependent on the timing of travelling and breeding.",,2006,94,3,511,525,,,,,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sand flies were captured using CDC light traps set in sand fly resting places overnight, and temperature, relative humidity and wind were recorded to establish possible relations between meteorological factors and vector densities. The most common species, of 5,432 specimens collected and identified, was Phlebotomus perniciosus (74%), followed by Sergentomyia minuta (6%) and Phlebotomus ariasi (1%). Male flies were highly predominant for all Larroussius species instead of S. minuta which counted (85%) of females. The results shed light on the wide population's dynamic of P. perniciosus in France showing a diphasic seasonal trend with two abundance peaks at the beginning of July and late August, when a mean temperature is from 23.3 to 25.7 degrees C. Interestingly, these two peaks are corresponding to the peaks of occurrence of human TOSV cases. Among the 1724 females collected, 549 (32%) were blood-fed. Based on the results of blood meal analyses, P. perniciosus fed on large animal's diversity (man, chicken, rabbit, others mammalians, etc.), including bats that are the only species found naturally infected by TOSV. Results indicate that host choice was probably related to its availability than specific attractiveness. Data presented confirm that sand flies easily adapted to the periurban sites like, P. pemiciosus may represent a public health concern for pathogen transmission in similar Mediterranean environments.

However, for animals with spatially separated feeding and breeding habitats, optimal reproductive timing may differ between parents and their offspring, leading to parent-offspring conflict. We assume that offspring have highest survival and fitness if they are spawned around a fixed date, and use state-dependent life-history theory to explore whether variation in conditions affecting only parents (food availability and survival) may influence optimal timing of reproduction. We apply the model to Pacific herring (Clupea palasii) in Puget Sound, USA, where 20 subpopulations spawn at different times of the year. Our model suggests that relatively small differences in adult food availability can lead to altered prioritization in the trade-off between maternal fecundity and what from the offspring's perspective is the best time to be spawned. Our model also shows that observed among-population variability in reproductive timing may result from adults using different feeding grounds with divergent food dynamics, or from individual variation in condition caused by stochasticity at a single feeding ground.

Here we used genetic (F-ST) and quantitative trait (P-ST) differentiation to assess local adaptation among three natural populations of Eruca sativa (Brassicaceae) distributed along a climatic range representing desert, semi-arid and Mediterranean habitats. Results Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis revealed high genetic diversity in each population, but low genetic differentiation between populations and relatively high gene flow. Further phenotypic evaluation in a common garden experiment (conduced in a Mediterranean habitat) showed clear differences in phenological traits among populations (day of flowering and duration of the reproductive stage), shoot and root biomass, as well as fitness-related traits (total number of fruits and total seed weight). F-ST-P-ST comparison showed that P-ST values of the phenological traits, as well as below- and above-ground biomass and fitness-related traits, were higher than the F-ST values. Conclusions Overall, our results support the identification of genotypic and phenotypic differentiation among populations of E. sativa. Furthermore, the F-ST-P-ST comparison supports the hypothesis that these were subjected to past diversifying selection. Thus, the results clearly demonstrate adaptive divergence among populations along an aridity gradient, emphasize the ecological value of early flowering time in arid habitats, and contribute to our understanding of the possible impact of climate change on evolutionary processes in plant populations.",MAR 30,2022,22,1,,,40,10.1186/s12862-022-01996-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-022-01996-w,,View Full Record in Web of Science

This cycle closely followed 11- and 22-year cycles in solar irradiance and local weather (e.g., winter precipitation and spring temperature), generating the hypothesis that solar activity may affect porcupine abundance through effects on local weather. We investigated the mechanisms linking porcupine abundance to local weather conditions using a 6-year study (2000-2005) involving individual mark-recapture, radio tracking, seasonal survival analyses and identification of mortality causes. Summer (May-August) survival was high and constant over the study period, whereas winter (August-May) survival was lower and varied during the duration of our study. Variations in local winter precipitation explained 89% of the variation in winter survival. Porcupine predation rates appeared strongly related to snow conditions; 95% of depredated porcupines were killed when snow was covering the ground, and predation rates were higher in years with increased winter precipitation. Our data thus support the hypothesis that changes in predation rates under different snow conditions were the mechanism relating climate to porcupine population dynamics, via modifications of the local predator-prey interactions and impacts on porcupine winter survival. Our study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting an effect of climate on predator-prey processes. Also, it identifies one possible mechanism involved in the relationship between solar irradiance and porcupine population cycles observed at this study site over a 130-year period.",OCT,2010,52,4,537,546,,10.1007/s10144-010-0198-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10144-010-0198-5,,View Full Record in Web of Science
